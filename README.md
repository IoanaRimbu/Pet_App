# Pet_App
work sample swagger

## Run the project
You just need to instal the node modules and run the project:
-npm install
-npm start

## Description
This project is built with Reactjs
I used demo api Swagger to bring the data of the pets
https://petstore.swagger.io/
So that things go faster, I used Antd

The project includes:
1. Landing page

2. Animal listing (individual page)
Status filter (available, pending, balance);
The table header should consist of: Index (starts from 1), Name, Status, Actions;
In the “Actions” column there should be buttons for viewing, editing, deleting the item;

3. Add (individual page)
There should be validation for the required fields (name, status and number type id);
The status dropdown options are: available, pending, balance.
After sending the form, display success and error notification;
In case of success, after the addition to be redirected to the list of animals;

4. Edit (individual page)
Validation for mandatory fields;
After sending the form, display success and error notification;
If successful, redirect to the list of animals after editing.

5. View (individual page)
We display the available information, even if it is minimal.

6. Clear
there is a mode / pop-up to confirm the deletion;
success and error notification;
update the list after deleting an item

Enjoy Coding ❤
